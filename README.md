Consider Herbs is a Jamstack web app and e-commerce site built using Gatsby with React components, allowing visitors to learn about and purchase herbs, as well as viewing wellness videos produced and curated by the brand. This app also integrates with a CMS to give the client hands-on access to update the site's and store's contents.

This app serves the term project for the University of Florida's CEN3031 Spring 2021 course
