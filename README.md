Consider Herbs is a MERN stack web app and e-commerce site allowing visitors to learn about and purchase herbs, as well as viewing wellness videos produced and curated by the brand. This app also features an admin backend to give the brand hands-on access to update the site and store's contents.

This app serves the term project for the University of Florida's CEN3031 Spring 2021 course
